Our research interest is in the field of pharmacometrics. Our aim is to use quantitative pharmacology methods to enhance precision therapeutics and facilitate efficient drug development. More specifically, we take advantage of modeling and simulation approaches to:  

* Elucidate the dose-exposure-response relationships of therapeutics, identifying and quantifying the sources of variability in pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics (PK/PD).   
* Understand disease progression and mechanism of drug actions.  
* Strategically guide the design of future studies that assess drug safety and efficacy, thereby facilitating more efficient drug development.

Our lab is part of the [Department of Experimental and Clinical Pharmacology (ECP)](https://www.pharmacy.umn.edu/experimental-and-clinical-pharmacology) at [the University of Minnesota College of Pharmacy](https://www.pharmacy.umn.edu/).
