    "text": "3.2 Build a project directory from scratch\n\n3.2.1. Build a Github repository\nGithub is a useful tool for collaborative coding, facilitating both code review and management. University of Minnesota provides complimentary access to GitHub Enterprise for all students and employees possessing an active Internet ID. Establishing a GitHub repository can significantly improve the efficiency and collaborative experience of a PMx project. While this blog post will not provide a detailed GitHub tutorial, those interested in a comprehensive exploration of its capabilities are encouraged to consult this document for further information. Briefly,\nStep 1: Registering / signing in University of Minnesota GitHub Enterprise. Initialize a new GitHub repository (i.e, project-abc) by clicking “New repository” tab. Then, specify the settings (e.g., name, visibility, etc) and create the repository.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 2: If you have already set up your GitHub SSH key. Clone the repository into your MSI Rstudio Server session through “terminal” using the SSH option as shown below. Other options such as HTTP and GITHUB CLI are also available but will not be covered in this blog.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 3: After git clone, the GitHub repository you created should appear in your MSI disk. You can now interact with your GitHub repository and replies on it to synchronize your work with your collaborators.\n\n\n3.2.2. Using renv for package version control\n\n\n\n\n\nrenv is a useful package to create reproducible environment for each R project. Instead of using library of R packages installed globally for every project. renv allows you to create project specific library to ensure the package version consistent across an R project.\n\n\nStep 1: Create an R project\nTo use renv, You need to create an R project (.Rproj) in the cloned GitHub repository.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 2: Initialize renv\nIn your R console, type in renv::init() to initialize the structure of the R environment using renv.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe structure of the environment includes:\n\n.Rprofile: R session automatically runs this script every time you open this R project (i.e., project-abc.Rproj), this ensures the automatic activation of renv.\nrenv/library: the project specific R package library.\nrenv.lock: a record of R packages installed, including all the dependencies.\n\nStep 3: Install packages\nUsing renv, we can install R packages using renv::install(). For example:\n\nrenv::install(\"mrgsolve\") will install mrgsolve package from CRAN\n\nrenv::install(\"metrumresearchgroup/bbr\") will install latest bbr package from GitHub of metrumresearchgroup\n\nHere, I want to install 5 packages into my project folder:\n\nmrgsolve from CRAN.\ntidyverse from CRAN.\nnmrec from GitHub of metrumresearchgroup.\nbbr from GitHub of metrumresearchgroup.\nhere from CRAN.\n\nI can install them by running:\n```{r}\nrenv::install(\"mrgsolve\", \n              \"tidyverse\", \n              \"metrumresearchgroup/nmrec\",\n              \"metrumresearchgroup/bbr\", \n              \"here\")\n```\nWhen asked whether you want to proceed, simply answer Y (yes) to proceed to the next step. The installation might take a while depending on the size of the packages, whether these packages were cached and the configuration of the Rstudio session. When the installation finishes, you should see all the requested packages installed in the renv/library directory.\nStep 4: Create a snapshot of the installed packages\nrenv::snapshot() allows you to create a snapshot of the installed packages, which enables your collaborators to use renv::restore() to restore the same R packages with the same version from the same source in their Rstudio Server session This would ensure the project reproducibility.\nTo accomplish this, we need to first create a new R script library.R in the project directory. This script does nothing but simply library all the packages installed.\nExample code for library.R:\n```{r}\nlibrary(mrgsolve)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(nmrec)\nlibrary(bbr)\nlibrary(here)\n```\nSubsequently, we can run renv::snapshot() in the R console. This will update the renv.lock file in the project folder.\nUsing GitHub to synchronize your renv.lock file with your collaborators, they should now be able to install the same version of packages in their Rstudio Server session using renv::restore() according to the updated renv.lock. Similarly, if they update renv.lock on their end, you could also run renv::restore() to restore their installation."

Hydrocortisone is commonly prescribed for managing CAH in pediatric patients. Collaborating with clinicians, we are actively developing integrated pharmacometric models to characterize the dispositions of hydrocortisone and associated biomarkers. These models are subsequently used as tools to explore the exposure-response relationships using clinically relevant endpoints. Ultimately, this research aims to tailor hydrocortisone dosing to the individual needs of pediatric patients, enhancing clinical outcomes.\nModel-based approaches to identify and quantify the impact of pharmacogenomics and pharmacomicrobiomes on drug exposures and drug-drug interactions (DDIs): Genomics and microbiome are crucial sources of variability in pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. We aim to elucidate and quantify their effects under pharmacometric modeling frameworks, facilitating the clinical implementation of these biomarkers to guide precision therapeutics. We are also interested in exploiting disparate sources of real world data (e.g., electronic health records) to empower our analyses.

Recently, several engaging discussions on VPC fundamentals emerged during ECP8500 Advanced Pharmacometrics (aka. Pharmacometrics Coffee Break), which motivated the creation of this blog.\nIn this blog, we walk through the step-by-step process of constructing a VPC, to visually assess the predictive performance of a model by comparing simulated predictions against observed data.\nDisclaimer: This blog is intended solely for educational purposes, and aim to illustrate, step-by-step, why VPC is needed and how VPC can be created without using packaged VPC functions. In practice, most of the procedures described here can be easily implemented using well-developed software tools, such as R packages vpc and tidyvpc, or similar functionality in other programs.\nAll data and model in this blog are synthetic and are included purely for demonstration purposes."
